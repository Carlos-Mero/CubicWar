# CubicWar

A danmaku STG developed with Godot Engine!

This game is still under early development.

The original passion for writing such a game is mainly for practice,
but I'm also focused on the quality of the game, being a little strict on
the art appearence, and implementing the game in pure C++ for the best
performance.
